  GitHub is a tool we all rely on, but most of us don't use it to its full
  potential. This tech talk covers some disused features that are currently
  available, as well as some interesting new features coming to Enterprise later
  this year.

  <h2>GitHub Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>

  <h5>June 26th 2020 Tech Talk</h5>
  <aside class="notes">
    We all depend on GitHub, but don't use it to its full potential. Today, I'm
    sharing some tips and tricks you might find useful to get the most out of
    your GitHub experience.

  <h3><a href="https://kbielefe.github.io/talks/" target="_blank">This site</a></h3>
  <aside class="notes">
    If you didn't know, GitHub can host static web pages for you. That means
    HTML and JavaScript only, no backend, but you can do a lot with that with
    the help of a static site generator. I have a repo hosting the slides for
    talks I have given, including this one. You can also set it up for hosting
    things like the Scaladoc for your library. I even have a search feature!

    Just put your generated site in the gh-pages branch. Lots of help for doing
    this in the documentation.

  <h3><a href="https://github.com/notifications" target="_blank">Notifications Page</a></h3>
  <aside class="notes">
    This one I was reminded of by Chris. If you spend a lot of time on GitHub
    anyway and are having trouble keeping up with your notifications, using this
    page can help. This is my public GitHub notifications, so it mostly consists
    of libraries I keep an eye on, but anything you would get an email for, such
    as new pull requests, you can manage from this page.

<section>
  <h3><a href="https://github.com/kbielefe" target="_blank">Status</a></h3>
  <aside class="notes">
    This is a handy feature not so much for daily use, but if you go on vacation
    or something while people are making changes you requested on a pull request
    or something. You can set your status so when people interact with you on
    GitHub, they will know you won't be able to get to something for a while.

<section>
  <h3><a href="https://github.com/kbielefe/talks/actions" target="_blank">Actions</a></h3>
  <aside class="notes">
    This has been one of my favorite relatively new features. It is coming to
    Enterprise later this year. I don't know how exactly it is going to work,
    but I've been impressed by its stability so far for my personal projects
    like this talks site.

    Here you can see I have set up an action to publish the website when I push
    to master. This is necessary because the slides require an npm installed
    library. A lot of sites can be made without any actions at all.

    One thing I really like is the cache feature. Here the npm install takes
    under a second, because it was restored from cache and my package-lock.json
    did not change.

    If you look at the code, you can see that there are a number of triggers
    available, and it is a relatively simple yaml file. Unlike Jenkins, where
    you have one Jenkinsfile, you can have multiple workflows, each with
    different triggers. For example, if you have a repo with a website for its
    documentation, you can create a workflow that only runs when the
    documentation folder changes.

  <h3><a href="https://help.github.com/en/packages" target="_blank">Packages</a></h3>
  <aside class="notes">
    Packages are not something I have personally used yet, but probably will
    soon. Packages are basically an individual artifactory for every repo. You
    can put docker images in there, or an npm package, or a Scala jar file, to
    be used in actions or for creating releases, or to be used as dependencies
    in other repos.
  </aside>
</section>
<section>
  <h3><a href="https://github.com/kbielefe/talks/network/dependencies" target="_blank">Dependencies</a></h3>
  <aside class="notes">
    GitHub can find repos of your dependencies defined in a pom.xml or
    package-lock.json file, to create a graph, give you links to the repo, and
    automatically create pull requests when a security vulnerability is found.

<section>
  <h3><a href="https://github.com/explore" target="_blank">Explore</a></h3>
  <aside class="notes">
    The explore page is like Netflix recommendations, but for source code.
    GitHub looks at your public contributions and your stars, and brings code
    to your attention that you might not have found otherwise.

<section>
  <h3><a href="https://github.com/monix/monix/pulls?q=is%3Apr+label%3A"breaking+change"+is%3Aclosed" target="_blank">Labels</a></h3>
  <aside class="notes">
    Labels help you categorize issues and pull requests. I think this could be a
    good replacement for things like committizen. Here's an example of monix
    labeling breaking changes on pull requests. Labels can be read by actions to
    perform automation. They can also be set by actions.

<section>
  <h3><a href="https://github.com/monix/monix/milestone/26" target="_blank">Milestones</a></h3>
  <aside class="notes">
    Milestones help you track what's left in a release, or what all went into a
    large feature. They can be linked to a pull request, and to issues. These
    are useful for finer-grained coordination when working with a teammate.

<section>
  <h3><a href="https://gist.github.com/discover" target="_blank">Gists</a></h3>
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/kbielefe/41d987e4ac0d0f5c2ab365f8eddb097b.js"></script>
  <aside class="notes">
    Gists are a great way for exploring and discussing code that isn't
    substantial enough to be part of a pull request yet. You can have
    whiteboard-style discussions, and have a record of what was discussed if
    people have questions later. They can also be embedded in other places on
    the web, like this slide!

  <h3><a href="https://github.com/kbielefe/talks/commit/3af956a188b45a881ddbffc26db1fe42e62635f1" target="_blank">Commit signatures</a></h3>
  <aside class="notes">
    Have you ever wondered what the Verified means that's on some people's
    commits? If you didn't know, there is nothing stopping you from using
    someone else's name when you make a commit in git. The Verified means you
    have signed the commit using gpg, which people can verify cryptographically.
    It would be nice if GitHub gave a warning on commits that aren't signed by
    someone who usually signs their commits.

    It's not like Twitter blue checks. Anyone can get verified on GitHub. Just
    follow the instructions.

<section>
  <h3><a href="https://github.com/hannonhill/XSLT-Workbook/pull/5" target="_blank">Draft pull requests</a></h3>
  <aside class="notes">
    Draft pull requests are for creating a place to discuss code that you intend
    to merge at some point, but you are not ready at the moment. It clearly
    marks it as a work in progress, and you can set it as ready to review later.
    Draft pull requests have all the features of a pull request, like builds
    being run and allowing inline commenting, so they can be better than a gist
    for code that is part of a larger product.  These are good to get very early
    feedback, especially from someone you are collaborating with who works in a
    different time zone.

<section>
  <h3><a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/developing-online-with-codespaces" target="_blank">Codespaces</a></h3>
  <aside class="notes">
    Codespaces are an upcoming feature. Can't even try it on public GitHub yet
    unless you're in the limited public beta. I highly recommend watching the
    full demo from GitHub on this one. It's sort of like Sienna minivan in the
    browser. Everything you need for changing code in that repo, including your
    personal customizations for things like editor settings.
